## AMD Auto-checkout Module

\*\* Currently this module is experimental and not tested under heavy load, use at your own risk.

\*\* Pre Authorization is only available using PayPal for the moment

- Install the Tamper Monkey Chrome Extension
- Add the amd.js module as a script into Tamper Monkey
- Make sure the script is enabled
- Navigate to the custom menu page [https://www.amd.com/en/fqb](https://www.amd.com/en/fqb)
- Login with your Falco Q Buster V2 License
- Navigate to the products page and pre-authorize (using PayPal only) one or many products you wish to purchase 30 minutes BEFORE the drop.
- If you check the PrePay tab in the custom menu page, you will see all of your pre-auths
- For safety, during the drop, you must click the purple "Add to Cart" button manually to start the auto-checkout process.
- Once you complete the "Add to Cart" captcha, the auto-checkout process will complete.
- Please wait for 10-15 seconds for the process to complete
- If successful, you will be redirected to the order confirmation screen.

\*\* I realize this is not the best workflow. This is a work in progress. If problems, disable the script via Tamper Monkey, and manually checkout yourself.
